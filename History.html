Asian Computer College was established in
Mayapa, Calamba City on March 2000. During this year,
the school offered both the College Short Computer
Science Courses and Basic Education Curriculum -
Complete Pre-Elementary, Grade 1 to Grade 4 and 1st
Year and 2nd Year Levels. There were about 150 students
in all levels during the first year of operation and around
18 teachers.

                 <p>During its second year of operation, TESDA did not
allow the school to offer vocational courses because they
didn't want to use the same building that the elementary
and high school students were using. The management
would have to choose what to offer - the technical
Courses or the basic education curriculum. After a series
of studies and observation done by the administration
and management alike, they decided to offer only the
basic education curriculum. Thus, the college courses
were no longer offered during the second year. This time,
complete Pre-elementary, Elementary, and High School
courses were offered. The enrollment significantly
increased. In the year 2002, there were more or less 200
students in all Grade and Year levels. The teaching staff
also increased in number.

                 <p>The third year of the school marked a lot of
improvement in the physical facilities of the school. A
new science laboratory room was added; the library was
relocated to a bigger place because of the increasing
number of reference and reading materials, the
computer laboratory was fully air-conditioned with 30
computer units to accommodate the increasing number
of students. Additional classrooms were also opened in
time for the increase in the number of students. There
were about 398 students enrolled that year and there
were 22 teachers, a principal, an administrator, school
treasurer and the president of the board of directors. In
the year 2004 the school was relocated a larger space that

                 <p>Two years after the relocation of the school, a new
campus annex was built at Brgy. Punta, Calamba City.
There are two buildings built. The two-storey building is
for the High School Department while the one-storey is for
the Elementary Department. The next year, the Annex has
its own covered court where it is usually used as the place
of the Foundation Day of ACC.
